A **console-based calculator** built in Java that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program runs in a loop until the user chooses to exit.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. The program displays a menu:
   - `1` → Addition  
   - `2` → Subtraction  
   - `3` → Multiplication  
   - `4` → Division  
   - `5` → Exit  

2. User selects an option (1–5).  
3. If the option is 1–4, the program asks for **two numbers**.  
4. The operation is performed and the **result is displayed**.  
5. The menu appears again until the user chooses **Exit**.
